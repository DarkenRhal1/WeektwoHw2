 <h4> VARIABLES </h4>

<p> 
Variables must have a data type and name.
The value of a variable must correspond with the data type of that variable.  <br>
Example: Datatype variableName(in camelCase) = value;  <br>
	String name = "Klaus Mikhaelson";

Non-primitive variable are objects.
 
public class Originals { <br>
   publi String areYOu;  <br>
}

To create an object first declare a reference variable
{Originals name}  <br>

Give an object to the reference.  <br>
{= new Originals(); }  <br>

and finally, link them together  <br>
Originals name = new Originals(); 
</p>

<h4> ARRAYS </h4>
<p> An arrays is simply a variable except it's value is a list.
 <br>
Use the format below to creat an array.  <br>
int [] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};  <br>
Where the positions of the values are called indexes and are counted as whole numbers.
</p>

<h4>METHODS</h4>
<p> A class is the blueprint for an object. A method only runs when called. The behaviour of a method can 
vary depending on the variables within it.
 <br>
Example of a method:
public class Main {  <br>
 public void method() {  <br>
  }  <br>
}
